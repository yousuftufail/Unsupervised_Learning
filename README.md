This file contains an example of unsupervised learning with two set of points (both are uploaded separately).
After generating labels of an unsupervised data (new_points.csv), scatter plot is presentend that indicates 3 different clusters.

# Required Python Modules
1. numpy
2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. pandas
4. sklearn
5. seaborn (not compulsory but I like this enviornment for the representation of graphs)
